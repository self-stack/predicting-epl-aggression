## 3. Predict EPL championship qualifier teams
**Description:** I would like to predict which to 2 teams out of the 40 in the English Premier League (soccer) will be championship qualifiers (league's Superbowl) based on 10 season historical team data.<br>
**My Approach:** Random Forest to classify team as qualifier or not. I will need to perform EDA further, but possibly Linear Regression to identify and engineer features to be used in the Random Forest<br>
**Deliverables** (How will people react): I will deliver my findngs in a markdown file in my repo and slides for presentations.<br>
**Data:**<br><br>
